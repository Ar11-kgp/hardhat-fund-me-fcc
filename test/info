Unit tests are done locally
Used to test minimal portions of our code
only run on dev chains
Can be done on:

-   local hardhqat
-   forked hardhat

Staging tests can be done on a testnet (LAST STOP b4 we deploy to the mainnet!!)
This might be where we run our code on a testnet or some actual network
only run on testnets
